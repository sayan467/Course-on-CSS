    <!-- CSS Specificity helps determine what style will be applied to the HTML element(s) when there are overlapping or multiple CSS rules -->
    <!-- the cascade algorithm
    1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
    2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
    3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser
    extension, or your authored CSS
    4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
    Lets look into all these one by one -->
    <!-- order of specificity--
    Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector -->

    <!-- Guys follow then 4.css file  -->
